# About Me
31, Male, was born in Ohio, moved to NC at 13 and grew up on Topsail Island. I've seen more states than I haven't. I've been on an awakening journey for over half of my life and everytime I reach a breakthrough in understanding our existence, it creates more questions. 

## Interests
#### 1. **Hobbies**

   - Writing code and apps, learning new programming languages, building LLMs, old school gamer, not much time for it these days and past my prime.
   - Anything to do with cars, trucks, karts - modifying, tuning, and racing them.
   - Traveling, I've driven from Ohio and Western NY to NC and Atlanta, GA to within 20 miles of the Texas Mexico Border. to the middle of the desert in Arizona, solo, and have driven through every state in between, including parts of old Rt. 66
   
#### 2. **Academic**

   Ultimately my personal goals place me in one of three places in the next 5-10 years:
   - In an AI company, working on developing true AGI
   - In a robotics labs, developing modern humanoid robots/androids, like Boston Dynamics Atlas, Teslas Optimus or Unitrees G1 robots.
   - In a quantum computer lab, pushing the limits of our understanding of computing.

#### 3. **Languages**

   - *Fantastic* English
   - ***Terrible*** Spanglish
   - Can count to 10 and sing "*Ohne Diche*" by Rammstein in German
   - Decent Python (PCEP Certified, PCAP Ready)
   - Okay Kotlin
   - Can read C/C++, and write it if I ~~try really hard~~, pray a little.
   - Wrote Go once


## Websites I recommend
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This site is the collection of every bug and issue known to programmers for decades. If you have a problem, odds are someone else has had it too, and they've already asked and likely have an answer waiting for you.

- [Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) - One stop shopping for all open source AI models currently trained, as well as datasets to create your own Models and Agents. *Skynet will probably start from this site, if anywhere.*

- [US Debt Clock](https://www.usdebtclock.org/) - Look at all the pretty colors and numbers. Nevermind what any of it means..
